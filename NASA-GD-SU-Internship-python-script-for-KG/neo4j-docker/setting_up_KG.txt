1. enter the directory where the docker-compose.yml file is located
2. run "docker-compose up" in the terminal and what until it is started 
3. run "docker ps" and pull the container ID
4. run "docker exec -it container_ID bash to enter the directory "/var/lib/neo4j"
5. run "cd conf"
6. run "apt updat" (this needs to be in the conf directory)
7. run "apt install nano" 
8. run "nano apoc.conf"
9. inside the apoc.conf file add the following lines 
    apoc.export.file.enabled=true
    apoc.import.file.enabled=true
    apoc.import.file.use_neo4j_config=true
then save and exit the apoc.conf file and then exit the directory 
10. run "docker restart container_ID"
11. run "docker-compose up"
12. In the neo4j browser enter the preset username and password which are both neo4j 
13. Now it will ask you to change the password. Change the password to: shannon-spain-field-switch-topic-8121
14. To run the python script you need to make sure the path to you the files you want to pull from is explicitly in the docker-compose.yml file as well as the python file
15. Now you can run the python script and then check the neo4j browser for the generated graph
